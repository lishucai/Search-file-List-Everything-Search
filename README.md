# Search-List-Everything-Search

This is a simple Python script to copy a list of files with the same format and copy them into a directory using Everything Search program (or maybe other search apps).

the main purpose of providing this script is to find just some desirable files from numerous mp3 files (over 3GB) which have been downloaded through the other script:
